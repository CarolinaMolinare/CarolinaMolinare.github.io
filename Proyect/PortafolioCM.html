        Analysis of Fertility Rates in Chile
    </h1>
    
    <h2 class="small" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> 
        Chile faces an unprecedented demographic crisis. With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman in 2023—and preliminary data suggesting a further drop to 1.03 in 2024—Chile has fallen far below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman needed to maintain population stability. <br>
        As shown in the first chart, Chile's fertility rate has declined dramatically since 2000, diverging sharply from the OECD average and accelerating its descent in recent years. <br>
        The second chart reveals a striking paradox: while Chile's GDP per capita has grown steadily from approximately $18,000 in 2000 to over $30,000 in 2024 (constant 2021 PPP dollars), it remains significantly below the OECD average of approximately $52,000. <br>
        Chile exhibits fertility rates characteristic of wealthy, post-industrial economies—comparable to South Korea (0.72) and Japan (1.2)— yet without having achieved their levels of economic development. <br>
        The third chart underscores this severity: among 38 OECD countries, Chile sits in the bottom tier alongside South Korea, Spain (1.12), and Italy (1.2). <br>
        The country has adopted the demographic patterns of developed nations while still being a developing economy, creating a unique policy challenge where ultra-low fertility threatens long-term growth prospects before Chile has completed its economic convergence.<br>
        This demographic transformation poses structural challenges across multiple dimensions: it strains the sustainability of the social security system, reduces the future contributor base, affects labor force availability, and demands a profound revision of public policies oriented toward collective well-being.
