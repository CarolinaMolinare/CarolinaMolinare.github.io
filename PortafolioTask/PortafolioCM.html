            <h2>Section 3: Using a visualisation in policy commentary</h2>
            <p> 
                Some political sectors advocate for health policies that increase public funding for assisted reproduction.
                This is because the fertility rate is very low in Chile (1.16 children per woman), largely below the OECD average (1.49 children per woman). 
                Also, women between 30 and 39 represent almost 50% births in the country. 
                We can see a trend where the decision to become a mother occurs at older ages when pregnancy is riskier.

            <h2>Section 4:  Re-creating, someone else’s chart.</h2>
            <p> 
                This is the graph that Chilean ex-president Sebastian Piñera shows during an official debate for the presidency about delinquency in Chile.
                 He used it to argue that, under his previous administration (2010-2013), the crime rate was lower than in other presidential terms. 
                 However, the figure is a clear example of misleading data visualization: it manipulates the scale to exaggerate differences and make a modest variation appear disproportionately large.
                 The second graph shows how the same data should be displayed with an appropriate scale—an approach that would have been far less supportive of Piñera’s narrative. 
                 He ultimately won that election.

        <figure id="Location9"></figure>
            <p> 
                The first key change is to show a fully comparable series and clarify that the indicator measures victimization (not delinquency).
                Importantly, the victimization methodology was updated in 2016, which means the 2010 figure shown by Piñera comes from the old methodology and should not be plotted or compared as if it were equivalent.
                Using the consistent post-2016 series, the victimization rate varies only modestly over the period.
