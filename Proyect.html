    <h1 class="big">Analysis of Fertility Rates in Chile</h1>
    <h3 class="small">How has the fertility crisis evolved in Chile?</h3>

    <div class="intro-box">
      <p>
        Chile is facing an unprecedented demographic crisis. In 2024, the country’s fertility rate fell to just
        <strong>1.03 births per woman</strong>—one of the lowest levels observed globally. This is far below the
        <strong>replacement level of 2.1</strong> needed to maintain a stable population, and it signals a structural shift
        in Chilean society with long-run implications for ageing, labour supply, and social protection systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how did we get here? And what does this crisis look like when we zoom in across different dimensions—over time,
        across age groups, across regions within Chile, and in comparison to international benchmarks?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>International context</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Fertility decline is not new in Chile, but the pace of the recent drop is striking. This chart pulls the total fertility
      rate series directly from the <strong>World Bank’s WDI API</strong> (1960–2023), so the visualization is reproducible and
      automatically linked to the underlying source. Chile is shown against World Bank income-group aggregates.
      Hovering over a year reveals the exact values for all groups in a single consolidated tooltip.

      To show how severe Chile’s situation is in 2023, fertility rates are benchmarked against other OECD countries.
      While Chile already has preliminary data for 2024, year 2023 is used here because it is the latest year that is broadly
      comparable across OECD members. The data come directly from the <strong>World Bank’s WDI API</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Chile sits near the bottom of the distribution. South Korea is the clear extreme case, but Chile remains among the
      lowest-fertility countries in the OECD.

    <h2>Who is (and isn't) having children?</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Using Chilean birth records from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), this <strong>interactive calculator</strong> is designed to capture changes that are hard to read precisely
      from a standard line chart. Instead of estimating differences by eye (or calculating them manually), the tool returns the exact percentage change for any
      age group and any pair of years, computed as <strong><em>(end − start) / start × 100</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The figure combines a multi-series line chart with a separate “calculator panel” that performs the year-to-year lookup and calculation,
      stitched into a single interactive view so the selections update both the highlighted line and the calculated result.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The pattern is not uniform across the life cycle: declines are concentrated in younger cohorts, whereas births at older ages fall less dramatically.

    <p class="chart-caption">
      This chart complements the age-specific rates by showing how the distribution of births has shifted across age groups.
      By 2024, 30–34 accounts for the largest share. This is not “postponement only”: declines at younger ages are not fully offset later.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The percentages shown were constructed in the underlying dataset. In Vega-Lite, the data are reshaped with a fold transform and
      the stacked bars are normalised so each year sums to 100%.

    <h2>The territorial dimension</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Fertility trends also have a spatial dimension. The map shows the number of births across Chilean regions by year.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The Región Metropolitana dominates: because its birth counts are much higher than other regions, it is displayed using a separate blue scale.
      The rest of the country uses a green scale so regional variation remains visible rather than being compressed.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The slider shows a key point: births are declining across <em>every</em> region. This is not only a Santiago phenomenon—the crisis is national.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The main technical challenge was implementing two independent colour scales while keeping a single year slider controlling both layers.
      A KPI box overlays the map to display national totals.

    <h2>Labor market status</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      This final chart adds a labour-market lens to the fertility story. Using INE vital statistics (2010–2022), it shows the
      <strong>share of births</strong> to mothers recorded as <strong>economically active</strong> versus <strong>inactive</strong> each year.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      “Not specified” (NA) cases are excluded so shares are computed only over births with recorded labour-market status.
      A consolidated hover tooltip reports both shares year-by-year, with a vertical rule to support reading.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The takeaway is compositional: over time, a larger share of births is associated with active mothers. The chart does not measure the level
      of births directly, but it highlights how the profile of motherhood has shifted alongside the broader fertility decline.

    <h2>Closing remarks</h2>
    <p>
      Chile's fertility crisis is structural, sustained, and accelerating. It's not confined to one region or one age group.
      Women are having children later, but they're also having fewer of them overall. Compared to international peers, Chile stands
      as an extreme case. The policy implications are significant: an aging population, fewer workers supporting more retirees, and
      pressure on social protection systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding how this crisis has evolved—across time, space, and demographics—is a first step toward designing evidence-based responses.
      Data and code are publicly available on GitHub, and automated API calls ensure the visualizations can be updated as new data become available.
