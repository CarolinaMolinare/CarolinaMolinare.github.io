    <h1 class="big">Analysis of Fertility Rates in Chile</h1>
    <h3 class="small">How has the fertility crisis evolved in Chile?</h3>

    <div class="intro-box">
      <p>
        Chile is facing an unprecedented demographic crisis. In 2024, the country’s fertility rate fell to just
        <strong>1.03 births per woman</strong>—one of the lowest levels observed globally. This is far below the
        <strong>replacement level of 2.1</strong> needed to maintain a stable population, and it signals a structural shift
        in Chilean society with long-run implications for ageing, labour supply, and social protection systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how did we get here? And what does this crisis look like when we zoom in across different dimensions, such as, over time,
        across age groups, across regions within Chile, and in comparison to international benchmarks?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>International context</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Fertility decline is not a new phenomenon in Chile, but the recent pace of decline is striking. 
      This chart pulls the fertility rate series directly from the <strong>World Bank’s WDI API</strong> (1960–2023), so the visualization is reproducible and automatically linked to the underlying source. 
      Chile is shown against World Bank income-group aggregates. While all groups show decline, Chile has fallen faster and further. 
      Hovering over a year reveals the exact values for all groups in a single consolidated tooltip.

      Chart 2 compares Chile's fertility rates with those of other OECD countries to illustrate the country’s challenging situation.
      While Chile already has preliminary data for 2024, the year 2023 is used here because it is the latest year that is broadly comparable across OECD members. 
      The data comes directly from the <strong>World Bank’s WDI API</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Chile sits near the bottom of the distribution. South Korea is the clear extreme case, but Chile remains among the lowest-fertility countries in the OECD. 
      This is particularly striking, given that Chile’s GDP per capita is still below that of most peers with similarly low fertility rates.

    <h2>Who is (and isn't) having children?</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Using Chilean birth records from the <a href="https://github.com/CarolinaMolinare/CarolinaMolinare.github.io/tree/main/Proyect/Part2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> National Institute of Statistics (INE)</a>, we first visualize the evolution of the Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR)—births per 1,000 women—by age group over time.
      To make dynamics easier to quantify, we complement the multi-series line chart with an interactive calculator designed to capture changes that are hard to read precisely from a standard plot. 
      Instead of estimating differences by eye (or calculating them manually), the tool returns the exact percentage change for any age group and any pair of years, computed as <strong><em> (end − start) / start × 100</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The figure integrates both elements into a single interactive view: a line chart displaying ASFR trajectories by age group, and a separate “calculator panel” that performs the year-to-year lookup and calculation.
      User selections update both the highlighted series and the computed result.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The pattern is not uniform across the life cycle: declines are concentrated in younger cohorts, whereas births at older ages fall less dramatically.

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Chart 4 complements the Age-Specific Fertility Rates by showing how the distribution of births has shifted across age groups. 
      In 1992, more than half of births were to women under 30; by 2024, this pattern had reversed, with over 50% of births occurring to women aged 30 and above, and women aged 30–34 accounting for the largest share. 
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The percentages shown were constructed from the underlying INE birth-record data in the dataset (replication files available <a href="https://github.com/CarolinaMolinare/CarolinaMolinare.github.io/tree/main/Proyect/Part2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). 
      In Vega-Lite, the data are reshaped using a fold transform, and the stacked bars are normalized so each year sums to 100%.

    <h2>The territorial dimension</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      Fertility trends also have a spatial dimension. Map 1 shows the number of births across Chilean regions by year from 2010 to 2022, using the INE's data available
    <a href="https://github.com/CarolinaMolinare/CarolinaMolinare.github.io/tree/main/Proyect/Part3/Original%20Data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The Metropolitana region dominates because its birth counts are much higher than those of other regions, and it is displayed using a separate blue scale.
      The rest of the country uses a green scale, so regional variation remains visible rather than being compressed.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The slider shows a key point: births are declining across every region. This is not only a Santiago phenomenon, but the crisis is also national in scope.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      The main technical challenge was implementing two independent colour scales while keeping a single year slider controlling both layers.
      A KPI box overlays the map to display national totals.

    <h2>Labour market status</h2>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      This final chart adds a labour-market lens to the fertility story. Using INE data (2010–2022) available <a href="https://github.com/CarolinaMolinare/CarolinaMolinare.github.io/tree/main/Proyect/Part3/Original%20Data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>,
      it shows the annual share of births to mothers recorded as economically active versus inactive.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
      “Not specified” (NA) cases are excluded, so shares are computed only over births with recorded labour-market status.
      A consolidated hover tooltip reports both shares year by year, with a vertical rule to support easy reading.
    </p>

    <p class="chart-caption">
       The takeaway is that compositional changes occur over time; a larger share of births is associated with mothers who are actively involved in the labour market.
       The chart does not directly measure the level of births, but it highlights how the profile of motherhood has shifted in tandem with the broader decline in fertility.

    <h2>Closing remarks</h2>
    <p>
      Chile's fertility crisis is structural, sustained, and accelerating. It's not confined to one region or one age group.
      Women are having children later, but they're also having fewer of them overall. Compared to international peers, Chile stands
      as an extreme case. The policy implications are significant: an aging population, fewer workers supporting more retirees, and
      pressure on social protection systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding how this crisis has evolved—across time, space, and demographics—is a first step toward designing evidence-based responses.
      Data and code are publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/CarolinaMolinare/CarolinaMolinare.github.io/tree/main/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, and automated API calls ensure the visualizations can be updated as new data become available.
